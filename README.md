# Project_Marmot_Congress
This is code for extracting information from the congressional record. 
It's for viewing purposes at the moment, as my collaborator and I are working on making the 118th congress dataset available to all.
We have finished the first year of the 118th congress, and are working on the second!
This dataset will likely be available before the Pardee Atlas Conference at BU, as we will be presenting our research there.
